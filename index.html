                            This visualisation is used for learning more about life expectency, how it has changed over the years 1990 - 2013. Also you can learn about various causes of death, what are the
                            most probable way people die in specific region/country. You can also compare among countries and find out information like how different are causes of death in developed countries
                            compared to developing or under-developed countries.

                    <p>Data is about what are the different causes of death. It contains information collected from 1990 to 2013 and has information about all the countries. You can download the datasets from this 
                    <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/global-burden-disease-study-2013-gbd-2013-data-downloads">link</a>. Each file is around 30MB, stored in CSV format. You can view sample data in the screenshot.
                    Most of the data is collected from surveys run in different parts of the world. Collecting information at this particular level is really difficult since the data is not only about cause of death in
                     different 
                    coutries but also it is for a long period i.e. from 1990 to 2013. Also surveys were the first source for information since many of those countries doesn't have these kind of data readily available.
                    Also since the data is about all the countries data collected might be of various formats and integrating them together is another challenging job.

                                For example: When there is some improvement in the life expectency, the color was moving towards blue and when the life expectency was decreasing, color was moving towards red.</p>

                                   Also we have Play/Pause button which helps us and makes it easier for us to identify which countries/regions are moving towards blue color and which are moving towards red.</p>
